Project: Scalable DevOps Pipeline for a Microservices Web Application
1️⃣ Project Overview:
Build and deploy a containerized microservices application using AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, Prometheus, ELK Stack, and Security best practices.

2️⃣ Tech Stack & Tools:
Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, VPC, Load Balancer, Route 53, CloudWatch, Lambda)

Version Control: GitHub (Branching, Pull Requests, Webhooks)

CI/CD: Jenkins/GitHub Actions (Automated Builds, Tests, Deployments)

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform (Provisioning AWS infrastructure)

Containerization: Docker (Packaging microservices)

Orchestration: Kubernetes (EKS - Auto-scaling & Load Balancing)

Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Security: AWS IAM, Security Groups, HashiCorp Vault (Secrets Management), SonarQube (Code Quality & Security Scanning)

Scripting: Bash/Python (Automation tasks)

3️⃣ Project Workflow:
✅ Code Management:

GitHub repository with a structured branching strategy (main/dev/feature branches)

Automated code quality & security checks using SonarQube

✅ CI/CD Pipeline:

Jenkins Pipeline (or GitHub Actions) for:

Automated build & unit tests

Dockerizing the application

Security scans with Trivy/Snyk

Pushing images to DockerHub/ECR

Deploying to Kubernetes (EKS)

✅ Infrastructure Automation:

Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure

Ansible for configuration management

✅ Kubernetes Deployment:

Deploying microservices with Helm charts

Auto-scaling & Load Balancing using AWS ALB & Kubernetes HPA

✅ Monitoring & Logging:

Prometheus & Grafana for real-time monitoring

ELK Stack for centralized logging & log analytics

✅ Security Best Practices:

AWS IAM roles & policies for least privilege access

HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive credentials

SonarQube for code quality & vulnerability analysis
